What, Rick? What's going on?
It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about?
Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard!
Yeah, Rick... I-It's great. Is this the surprise?
What?! A bomb?!
T-t-that's absolutely crazy!
Jessica? From my math class?
Ohhh.
Whhhh-wha?
No, you can't!
What are you talking about, Rick?
I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyouï¿½
 That's it that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel.
I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy!
Oh, thank God.
It was?
Um...
I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.
Jessica.
Jessica.
Whoa! Hi, Jessica.
Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you!
Uh, that's flattering and a little weird.
Rename them?
Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot.
Uh, I-I'm just doing my best.
Ah, Jessica.
Jessica.
Je-Jessica. Jessica.
Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.
Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what'd you do to Frank?
I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again.
Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him?
Oh, geez, okay.
Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?
Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.
All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now?
Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.
The mega trees?
All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?
AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!
I'm in a lot of pain, Rick!
Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.
Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh!
Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you.
Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.
What?!
Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?
Uh-oh.
In my butt?
Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that.
Uuuh.
In my butt?
Oh, man.
Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy.
Aaaaaah!
Ohhhhh!
Ohhhhhh!
Aaaaah!
Whoooooo!
Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.
They're not robots, Rick!
Holy crap! This is insane!
Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my my Ferrari's in the shop. (Nervously Laughs) Just kidding.
Yeah.
Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all.
I do?
Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.
Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't.
1.77245385... Whoa!
"The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system." Wow! I'm so smart!
Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.
Aw, man.
Ohh, man. (Losing consciousness) Oh, geez! Ohh.
Summer, next time we're hiding in a Colorkian echo nest, can you do me a favor and turn your ringer off?
You look it up! Y-Y-You don't even-You don't even know what it means!
W-We'll see you every other weekend, though, right?
Th-That'll be nice. Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving!
Well, I-I better--
They all have mohawks!
Uh-huh, yeah, is it powerful enough to keep those guys from murdering us?!
Summer!
Rick, can we not leave without my sister?!

Jesus Christ. Summer!
What is your deal lately?
What?!
Listen, Rick, Summer's been acting pretty crazy lately. You know, I mean, I-I think the divorce is affecting her. And, you know, I don't think this is a great place for her to be right now.
(after a short pause) Seriously, Rick? Is it really easier to eat human flesh than to just tell me why we're still here?
Isotope 322.
Summer just ran off with strangers that have "Death" in their name, and the rest of their name was "Stalkers"!
Damn it, Rick, that's what I-- Fine. Just grab the stupid thing while I grab her, and let's get the "F" out of "H"!
"Distract"? They eat each other. Wha-What do you want me to do to get their attention, put on a puppet show?
Rick, what the hell, man?! Wh-What are you, out of your mind?!
I-I didn't do that!
Ooh! Help! Help!
Oh, God! Stop! Stop! This is horrible!
Okay, no more!
No, I don't!
Someone, make this stop!
(while beating up the Death Stalker) Why would you want this to happen? All you had to do was go away! Stop standing in the driveway talking about custody! And either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life, but whatever you do, stop being a baby and act like a man!
Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking through to something here. C-Can we not leave just yet?
Sorry, but can we not kill him? C-Can we just take him prisoner?
Why does it have to be such a dramatic choice? Can't we arrange a thing where we spend weekends here or or visit home to do laundry?
Booyah! Fuck you, pal! Who else wants some? Who wants to be my pussy of a dad today?
Whoa, whoa!
This isn't over, is it?
That means, no, it isn't over, or you disapprove of the question?
Ahh! Oh, gee!
L-Look, man, I'm just along for the ride on this one. You know, y-y-y-y-you're preaching to the choir here.
Uh, Armothy, can I steal you for a second? E-E-Excuse us, sir.
You're right. We both got to see our stuff through. I got to deal with my parents' divorce, and you got to, you know, do what you got to do. I love you.
Rick?
Yeah, well, too late.
Oh, but don't don't you have infinite versions of me and my sister?
Maybe the lesson we've learned is that, whether it's our parents' marriage, a glowing green rock, or an awesome, giant arm, sooner or later, we got to let it go.
Hey, there she is!
Uh-huh.
I got to admit, Rick, when you popped this scheme, I-I-I didn't -- I wasn't sure it was gonna work.
You know what? Yeah. I think if Dad really wanted to be here, he'd stop at nothing to make that happen. You know, maybe Dad just doesn't want you back, or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight. I-In either case, he's got his life, I got mine.
What the fuck? No. D-Do we have any oranges? I think I got a scurvy coming on.
Rick?
Rick?
Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something?
Rick? W-where are you?
Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?
What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.
And?
Was it?
Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick?
Well, can you move? Can you fly?
All right, well, do pickles live forever or --
I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.
Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?
Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?
Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?
He turned himself into a pickle.
Mom!
Anti-pickle serum.
Oh, my God!
I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.
Are we gonna go back?
I, I liked her.
Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die!
Who? Who was that, Rick?
What's wrong?
Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy.
Aw, man!
Snuffles.
That was fantastic, Rick!
W-w-w-what is it?
You talking about "Inception"?
"Inception" made sense.
Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?
Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.
Ooohhh!
What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!
Whooooa! Whoooooooa! Whoa! Whooooooooaaaaa!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a (Offscreen) mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!
Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.
Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.
Ooh, oh! Oh, man.
I'm sorry. No, no.
No, thanks!
No, I'm okay.
Whoa!
Summer?!
Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!
It's Summer! Aw, geez.
Oh, my God! Put some clothes on, for Pete's sake! This is disgusting! I can't take it, Rick!
What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.
Ooooooohhhhh! Holy crap!
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!
Huh?
Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good.
Ohhhh!
We're trying to incept me to get an "A" in math?
Ooooooaaahhh!
Man, he sure says "bitch" a lot!
But that's the opposite of what-
Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.
Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.
Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry.
Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool.
You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg.
What the hell?
Oh, man, what's going on?
Th-thanks, snuffles.
Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead!
What?
But I-it's been like a whole year!
Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.
Aw, man, geez! Seriously?
Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?
What?!
I'm gonna miss you, snowball.
Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.
You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.
